# Regression

## Project Summary

## Introduction
Regression is a statistical method to find a relationship between variables and make predictions. The independent variable (variable used to predict) is denoted $x$. The dependent variable (outcome) is denoted $y$. The simplest regression model produces a line of best fit, for a straight line, this takes the form
$$Y_j = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_j$$
where the fitted parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ represent the y-intercept and gradient, respectively.
The coefficients are evaluated as

$$ \beta_0 = \overline{y} -  \beta_1 \overline{x} $$

## Linear Regression
For this example, we use salary data to build a model to predict the salary based on the number of years of experience, we implement different methods of regression and compare them quantitatively looking at their coefficient of determination and the relative misfit.

We implement the method from scratch and via the scikit-learn toolkit.
