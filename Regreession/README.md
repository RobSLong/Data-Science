# Regression

## Project Summary

## Introduction
Regression is a statistical method to find a relationship between variables and make predictions. The independent variable (variable used to predict) is deonted $x$. The dependent variable (outcome) is denoted $y$. The simplest regression model produces a line of best fit, for a straight line, this takes the form
$$Y_j = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_j$$
