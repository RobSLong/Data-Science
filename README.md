# Data-Science

This repository contains projects focused around data science topics and each directory is intended to be a self-contained project with sufficient documentation to be used as educational content. Each project will typically consist of a basic walkthrough applied to data within a commercial setting and a more unique example focused on planetary science.

Each directory herein contains a self-contained project with the name describing the algorithm implemented. The <readme> in each directory should provide enough information to understand the problem and provide a foundation for similar projects to be undertaken!
