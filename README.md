# Data-Science
This repository contains projects focused around data science topics and each directory is intended to be self-contained with sufficient documentation to be used as educational content. The <readme> in each directory should provide enough information to understand the problem and provide a foundation for similar projects to be undertaken!

Projects Highlights
## Regression
We outline how to implement a linear regression model from scratch to highlight the underlying theory of the method (see Regression/scratch_regression) and show a multivariate regression implementation using scikit-learn (Regression/multiple_regression) to predict gross movie profit from domestic and opening weekend profits.

### Clustering
We implement K-means clustering algorithm to the problem of customer segmentation going through the process of data preprocessing, computing the optimal number of clusters and visualising teh results. We conclude by identifying the best selling item within each cluster of customers.

## Classification
Have you ever wanted to buy someone a t-shirt as a gift without knowing their size? We implement a binary classifier which is trained on height and weight data (two number you can estimate fairly accurately) to predict the whether a medium or large t-shirt is the more likely choice and the model does this with a 75% accuracy.

### Data Quality
Most machine learning and data science models are held back by the quality of the input data and data quality reporting is a valuable process in informing decision and assumptions upstream. The quality report generates a table listing the number of missing, null or invalid values and can be used as a baseline of how to evaluate more complex datasets.
