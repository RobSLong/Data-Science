# Clustering 

Algorithm
1. Choose number of clusters, $k$
2. Randomly initilaise $k$ centroids
3. Calculate the (Euclidean) distance between each data point in the training set with the $k$ centroids
4. Assign each data point to the closest centroid
5. Update centroid location by taking the average of the points in each cluster group
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 until the centroisd no longer change
